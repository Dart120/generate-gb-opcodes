# Generate Game Boy CPU Op Codes

This is a bit of a side project that came out of my attempt to make a Game Boy emulator. I was trying to make a table of op codes for the Game Boy CPU (similar to the one on [pastraiser](http://www.pastraiser.com/cpu/gameboy/gameboy_opcodes.html)), but doing it by hand was quite tedious. So this project is an attempt to dynamically create a similar table!
